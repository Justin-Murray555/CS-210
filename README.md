# Project Description
The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. I created a function to calculate:
  -  Bank monthly totals after interest without deposits
  -  Bank monthly totals after interest with depostis
  -  and formulated a table for the display

# What went particularly well
Calling from the header stucture in the main went smoothly
# How could you enhance code
You could add more functions to allow for more timeframes or interest rates flunctioning based on time. There could also be some code clean up with proper syntax
# Challenges
I struggled some getting the display table to line up at first
# Skills I can use moving forward
This project helped me work on designing a display screen as well as using different files parts, .cpp and .h
